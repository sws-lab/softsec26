// Exercise 6. Write a method that takes an integer array, which it requires to have at least one element, and returns an index to the maximum of the array’s elements.
// Annotate the method with pre- and postconditions that state the intent of the method, and annotate its body with loop invariant to verify it.

method FindMax(a: array<int>) returns (i: int)
  // Annotate this method with pre- and postconditions
  // that ensure it behaves as described.
{
  // Fill in the body that calculates the INDEX of the maximum.
}
