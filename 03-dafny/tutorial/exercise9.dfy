// Exercise 9. Implement left circular shift method for an array (i.e. element at index A in the original array shall have index A + 1 in the updated version,
// except for the last element which shall become the first).
// In the method contract and loop invariants, you may use old() function to access the array contents prior to modification.

method CircularShift(a: array<bool>)
    // Fill in the method contract
{
    // Fill in the implementation
}
