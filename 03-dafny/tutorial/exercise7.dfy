// Exercise 7. Write a method that uses a loop to compute sum of the first N natural numbers.
// Annotate the method with an appropriate postcondition and complete the loop body.

method sum(n: nat) returns (s: nat)
  /* Postcondition */ {
    while /* Termination condition */ {
      // Fill in the loop condition, body, invariants, etc.
    }
}
